        <img class="logo" src="Assets/Deer.svg" alt="logo" /> It is with great
        grief and sadness that I have to inform of the amount of
        <b>LinkedIn</b>
        messages, mails, texts and phone calls I receive, with offers not
        matching my field of expertise, experience, or basically anything that I
        mention about myself - this has gotten very much out of hand.
        <br />
        Therefore, I have decided to do what Web Devs do: create a website.
        Before you text me, call me, send me anything, or come knocking on my
        door, please, at least skimm the balow.
        <br />
        The list goes from a general "U should already know that, but just in
        case" to "here's what I do and what I expect." If your job offer doesn't
        match up with anything of the below, then let's just skip the
        interaction, cuz it's already dead to me (get it? Dead - obituary themed
        webside - heh).

There's like a million job offers sent my way every freakin' day. Stand out from at least some of them, have basic info: WHO is hiring (I'm not going to work for shady gambling companies, start-ups on life support etc.), WHAT is the tech stack ("Angular!" is not an answer, listing all the 36 languages that the company uses is another spectrum of also not an answer), WHAT am I supposed to deliver ("searching for a developer with expereience to do AI, ML and deliver extraordinary value to further the company's goal of creating <buzzwords>" is worthless marketing slogans that insult me, quite franky. WHAT EXACTLY? A web app, a website, PWA or not, SPA or not, one monolith or modular, stack is settled, or to be picked by the team?) and HOW MUCH they pay (yeah, competitive salary, negotiable is a different way of saying either "we have no idea about the industry" or "we're cheap and searching for a deal" - count me out).
